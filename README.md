# Baggins - A Discord Chat Moderation Bot
Baggins is a discord chat bot designed to moderate voice channels. Feel free to fork the code and use yourself, but beware of spaghetti!
This was created in 2 days for the 8th Repl.it codejam, by user @ArchieMaclean#5954. It uses discord.js, and Python's SpeechRecognition (Based on the Houndify API).
Note that I am using the free version of the Houndify API, so if it starts not working it's probably because I ran out of requests (100/day).
